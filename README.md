# EAGLE
Evolutionary, Automatic and Generic Learning Environment.

## About
EAGLE is a NAS implementation that finds neraul architectures without any arbitrary assumptions about thier internal structure.

## MNIST architecture search
In this experiment EAGLE finds a network model that can calssify MNIST handwritten characters. The diagram shows evolution of the model trained on a single CPU (not GPU).
